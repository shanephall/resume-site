Hello! My name is Shane Hall. I build cross-functional teams and high-impact features that deliver order-of-magnitude increases in conversion rates, monetization, and user satisfaction.  I recently concluded a 9-year tenure at **Change.org**, where I led Product, AI/ML, and Growth teams for the 500M+ user global platform.  Prior to that I scaled product and design at **Zynga**, **The Hunt**, **MySpace**, **AOL** and **USerplane**.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shanephall) or check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/shanephall) for more information about my projects and experience.

Thank you for visiting my site!
