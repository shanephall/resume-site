Hello! My name is Shane Hall. I build cross-functional teams and high-impact features that deliver order-of-magnitude increases in conversion rates, monetization, and user satisfaction.  I recently concluded a 9-year tenure at **Change.org**, where I led Product, AI/ML, and Growth teams for the 500M+ user global platform.  Prior to that I scaled product and design at **Zynga**, **The Hunt**, **MySpace**, **AOL** and **USerplane**.

Prior to that...
- **The Hunt**: I scaled Product and Design teams at The Hunt as Head of Product, launching mobile apps that led to acquisition by Pinterest.
- **Zynga**: I led the launch of Zynga.com, achieving 1M daily active users within three months.
- **MySpace**: managed highest traffic and revenue pages, spearheaded a data-driven redesign that doubled engagement on the homepage.
- **Userplane / AOL**: Led product and customer success for the early pioneer of live text, audio, and video apps.  I transformed the developer experience and onboarding for new customers, scaling the business and leading to successful acquisition by AOL.

- **Tech Stack**: SQL, Python, R, Databricks, PostgreSQL, MLflow, MySQL, Tableau, Looker, Google Analytics, Jira, Asana, Trello
